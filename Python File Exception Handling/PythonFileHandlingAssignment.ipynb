    "      multiprocessing Module:-The multiprocessing module is a higher-level Python module that provides a way to create and manage separate                                 processes with more flexibility than os.fork(). It provides features for inter-process communication (IPC),                                  synchronization, and managing processes.The multiprocessing module abstracts the low-level process creation by                               offering a more Pythonic interface, allowing you to spawn processes, share data between processes, and                                       synchronize them.It is cross-platform and works on both Unix-like systems and Windows. On Windows,                                           multiprocessing uses the spawn() method (not fork()) to create child processes, which ensures compatibility.\n",
    "                              The multiprocessing module includes several useful classes such as Process, Queue, Pipe, Lock, etc., to                                      facilitate process management and communication.Ideal for parallel processing and tasks that require higher-                                 level features like process pooling, inter-process communication, and synchronization mechanisms."

Each call to                               file.readline() reads the next line in the file and stops at the newline character.It returns a single line from the                         file, including the newline character at the end of the line (if present). Use file.readline() when you need to process                      the file line by line, which can be more memory-efficient if you're working with large files."

    "      1-Memory Leaks:A memory leak occurs when memory that is no longer needed by the program is not released, causing the program to                             consume more memory over time.\n",
    "      2-Overhead of Garbage Collection: Python uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory. The garbage collector                                                periodically checks for objects that are no longer in use, freeing up memory. However, this process                                          itself adds overhead, which can impact performance.\n",
    "      3-Unnecessary Memory Usage:Python objects can sometimes take more memory than necessary, particularly when using data structures like                                   lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "      4-Managing Large Data Structures: Python’s memory management can struggle with large data structures, especially when dealing with                                             large datasets, like large lists, dictionaries, or NumPy arrays.\n",
    "      5- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and Memory Usage in Multithreading: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python is a mechanism that                             ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time in a single process. While this simplifies memory                                  management, it can lead to inefficient use of multi-core systems, particularly in CPU-bound tasks."
